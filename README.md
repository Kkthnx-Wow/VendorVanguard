# VendorVanguard
> **Modular automated selling and repairing.**

VendorVanguard is a World of Warcraft addon designed to streamline your vendor interactions. It automatically handles selling junk items and repairing your gear whenever you visit a capable merchant, letting you get back to the adventure faster.

Its modular design means you have complete control over which automated features are active.

* **Junk Selling:** Automatically sells poor-quality (gray) items upon opening a vendor window.

* **Lightweight:** Designed to have minimal impact on game performance.
